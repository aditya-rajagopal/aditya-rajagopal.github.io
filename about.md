### Bio
Learning is my passion. I love to learn a wide veriety of topics including but not limited to pysics, psychology, history, computer vision, robotics etc. However my most recent endevours have been teaching machines to learn. My work at the robotics and cognative research lab introduced to me to the field of computer vision and deep learning. My first taste of ML came in the form of the task to help a driverless car identify which part of the scene is the road and which is not. This task after execution with multiple different algorithms lead me to deep learning. The whole task of trying to model they way a living brain processes information is extremely exciting and highly rewarding when done well.
